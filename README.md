# wuzzlefump.github.io-wk4-quiz
a timed quiz with a place for a highscore

The first page should have a start button

when clicked a timer will start and count down

when one question is answered you move on to a second question

if answered incorrectly time is subtracted from time limit

when time = 0 the game is over

then I can save my initials and score.
